## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Learned how to make entire elements clickable by expanding the size of the child element (e.g., making the ```<a>``` element cover the entire ```<li>```).

I also learned about the use of the pseudo-class :focus to enhance interactivity and accessibility. The importance of focus states for keyboard navigation and how to implement them using the :focus pseudo-class.

### Continued development

- Enhanced Accessibility:Implement ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes to improve accessibility for screen readers.
- Performance Optimization: Use lazy loading for images to improve performance on slower networks.
- Responsive Design: Further refine responsive design to ensure a seamless experience on all devices, including tablets and large screens. Test the design on various devices and browsers to ensure compatibility.
